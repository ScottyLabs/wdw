# REST APIs in Express

###### learn how to build a minimal and flexible web applicatoin

The backend is all about storing and persisting information.  It usually
consists of three main parts: a server, an application, and a database. If you
want to save a user’s preferences, do complicated calculations, or store a lot
of information, you’re going to need a backend.

Participants in this workshop will first get a brief overview of what backend
engineering is before learning how to make a simple blog using Flask, a web
application framework written in Python.


## How to Attend
