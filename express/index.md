# REST APIs in Express

###### Learn how to build a minimal and flexible web application with Node.JS and Express

Most modern websites and web applications involve some sort of backend framework to handle data going from a backend to some sort of database. You will be learning about the basics of what a REST API is and how to use it to expose data to a frontend.

Node.JS is one of the most popular and most powerful choices for desigining a website backend. In this talk, you will be learning about how Node.JS is used today to power websites as well as how to use a popular framework called Express to simplify developing a server.

After this talk, there will be a workshop where participants will get a hands-on experience working on building a basic Express app and testing their endpoints using Postman.

## How to Attend

Bring a computer with a web browser and a text editor installed. You will also need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
