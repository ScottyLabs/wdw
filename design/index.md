# Crafting <br>Well-Designed Sites

###### learn to build things that don't suck

This workshop will teach you a set of guidelines for making your applications
and websites work well. We'll cover the skills you need to judge a design, and
give you some rules to follow when evaluating a design.

people to expect and what people will be interested in learning. We can't wait,
and we hope to see you there!
