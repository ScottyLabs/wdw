# Crafting <br>Well-Designed Sites

###### learn to build things that don't suck

This workshop will teach you a set of guidelines for making your applications
and websites work well. We'll cover the skills you need to judge a design, and
give you some rules to follow when evaluating a design.

In the session, you'll make a spaceship interface under a variety of constraints.
