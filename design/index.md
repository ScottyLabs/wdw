# Crafting <br>Well-Designed Sites

###### learn to build things that don't suck

It’s often hard to identify what components contribute to a site feeling
“well-designed.” Indeed it’s been said that “Good design is invisible.
It’s only when something is poorly designed that we notice.” In this talk,
we’ll dissect two elements of good design: typography and grid.

Participants in this workshop will complete typographic sketches and mockups
to get a feel for how to think critically about design on the web.


### How to Attend

<!--
This workshop will be held on Sunday, November 8th at 3:00 p.m. in the Windows
Cluster in Wean.
-->

Bring a pencil; paper will be provided. Also bring a laptop with your favorite
design software installed, like [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/),
[InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/downloads.html), or
[Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/downloads.html). If you don’t have
something like this already installed, you can use the links above to find
free trials. Alternatively, attend the workshop with a friend who has this
software already installed. The Mac cluster computers will be available as well.
