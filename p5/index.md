# P5js

###### A Graphical Sketchpad for JavaScript

p5.js is a Javascript library that makes coding accessible for everyone. It has
a full set of drawing functionality, so your browser page becomes your
sketchbook. It greatly simplifies the process of coding visual, interactive web
programs and has add-on libraries that allow interaction with other DOM objects
such as text, input, video, webcam and sound.

Participants will learn the basics of p5.js through interactive examples, and
a longer lab session at the end where they will create their own mini p5.js
project!


### Prerequisites

Basic coding abilities, especially with JavaScript, will be helpful, but is not
necessary. This talk is meant for anyone interested in creative computing and
web development.
