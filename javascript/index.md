# Frontend JavaScript

###### make your pages interactive with JavaScript

JavaScript is everywhere on the Web. With only a few lines of code, we can make
immersive web applications, entertaining games, and interactive sites. Learning
JavaScript is somewhat treacherous if you’re just starting out, so we’ll make
sure to introduce you to JavaScript in a way that will enable you to continue
learning more.

Participants in this workshop will complete exercises related to common
JavaScript tasks.


## How to Attend

Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
