# App Engine

###### Focus on developing your projects without worrying about the maintenance
The Google App Engine allows developers to build and deploy large scale web applications,
all without having to worry about the annoyances of dealing with the infrastructure of
your project. With it, you can focus less on management of your project and spend more time
on the parts that matter: writing the code that will be used for your main application.

This talk serves as an introduction to the App Engine tool and how you can get started
with using it for your own projects.
