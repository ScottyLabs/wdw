# Frontend Development <br>with Angular.js


AngularJS is a powerful tool to create web-applications that are dynamic and efficient. Many of the most popular websites on the web use it, including its creator, Google, and Lyft.  This framework extends the capabilities of HTML code, while making data binding easier. AngularJS will change the way you think about front-end development. 

Participants in this workshop will learn how to develop a basic Angular JS application while learning the overall structure of this framework.
