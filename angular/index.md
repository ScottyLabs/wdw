# Frontend Development <br>with Angular.js


AngularJS is a powerful tool to create web-applications that are dynamic and
efficient. Many of the most popular websites on the web use it, including its
creator, Google, and Lyft.  This framework extends the capabilities of HTML
code, while making data binding easier. AngularJS will change the way you
think about front-end development.

Participants in this workshop will learn how to develop a basic Angular JS
application while learning the overall structure of this framework.


### How to Attend

Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend
