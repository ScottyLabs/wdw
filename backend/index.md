# Backend Development

###### learn how to save information, serve up different pages, and more

The backend is all about storing and persisting information.  It usually
consists of three main parts: a server, an application, and a database. If you
want to save a user’s preferences, do complicated calculations, or store a lot
of information, you’re going to need a backend.

Participants in this workshop will first get a brief overview of what backend
engineering is before learning how to make a simple blog using Flask, a web
application framework written in Python.


### How to Attend

Bring a computer with a web browser and a text editor installed.
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are recommended.  Please also have
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed as well as
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), a Python package manager.

This talk assumes you've programmed before, either for a class or on your own
time.
