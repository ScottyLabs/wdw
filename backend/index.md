# backend development

###### Learn how to save information, serve up different pages, and make a blog.

The backend is all about storing and persisting information. If you want to save a user's preferences, do complicated calculations, or store a lot of information, you're going to need a backend.

Participants in this workshop will learn how to make a simple blog in Flask, a popular Python framework.

Although this workshop can be taken on its own, we recommend pairing it with [HTML & CSS]({{ site.baseurl }}/html/) so that you get a better idea of what's happening on the client side.

### What to bring
Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

You will also need to install python and setup Flask. Follow the instructions for your operating system below.
