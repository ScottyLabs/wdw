# Backend Development

###### learn how to save information, serve up different pages, and make a blog

The backend is all about storing and persisting information. If you want to save
a user's preferences, do complicated calculations, or store a lot of
information, you're going to need a backend.

Flask is a popular micro web application framework written in Python. Participants
in this workshop will first get a brief overview of what backend engineering is before 
we will learn how to make a simple blog using Flask. The workshop will go over
templating with Jinja, setting up forms, as well as user registration and login
with a database.

### How to Attend

This workshop will be held on Saturday, November 7th at 5:00 p.m. in the Windows
