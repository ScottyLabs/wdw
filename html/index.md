# Introduction to <br>HTML & CSS

###### build informative websites

HTML and CSS form the foundation of website on the Internet is built upon.
If you want to learn web development, HTML and CSS should be your first
stepping stone. This talk will be interactive: attendees can follow along with
the concepts introduced in the slides with the companion tutorial. By the end
of the tutorial, participants will have a custom resume website.

The HTML and CSS talk will do two things. The first is to show your how to
write HTML and CSS code that will render a webpage just the way you want.
The second is to give you a basic understanding of the structure of webpages,
known as the DOM. Both are important if you would like to learn to make more
interactive websites in the JavaScript, and Angular talks.

### How to Attend

Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is
also a great editor for web development, but might be a bit overwhelming if this
is your first experience writing a lot of code.If you're more comfortable with
another editor, feel free to use it.


## Resources

To follow along, go to the
[demo website](https://scottylabs.org/wdw-htmlcss/). As we introduce new
topics during the talk, the companion website will show you examples of source
code and its output to illustrate concepts.

We also created a list of suggested websites and other [resources](resources/) for
further exploration once you are finished with the talk.

The slides can be found [here](https://scottylabs.org/wdw-htmlcss/HTMLCSS.pdf).
