# Frontend Engineering

###### make your pages interactive with JavaScript

JavaScript is everywhere on the Web. With only a few lines of code, we can make 
immersive web applications, entertaining games, and interactive sites. Learning 
JavaScript is somewhat treacherous if you’re just starting out, so we’ll make 
sure to introduce you to JavaScript in a way that will enable you to continue 
learning more.

Participants in this workshop will complete exercises related to common 
JavaScript tasks.
