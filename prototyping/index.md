# UX Prototyping <br>with Framer.js


FramerJS is a ground-breaking prototyping tool for designers. With minimal
lines of code, designers can design the unimaginable and test their designs
out before handling specs to developers. It becomes easier to craft and
communicate interactions, as well as populate the interfaces with real data.
Whatâ€™s more, every FramerJS prototype looks just a real product!

Participants will make their own interactive FramerJs prototype at the end of
the workshop.


### How to Attend

Bring a computer with [Framer (Mac only)](https://framerjs.com/) installed.
Unfortunately, if you are a Windows or Linux user, Framer will not be available.
