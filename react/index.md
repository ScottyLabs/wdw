# React

###### A JavaScript library for building modular user interfaces

React is a popular JavaScript tool for creating well-structured and manageable
applications for web and mobile environments. Its simple but powerful
API makes it a great tool for developers thinking of creating entire web
applications from scratch. In addition, it has a variety of support from
companies across the industry, such as Facebook, Netflix, AirBnB, and more! If
youâ€™re thinking of taking your web development skills to the next level, then
join us for our React talk!

## Talk Content

We will be introducing some of the core concepts behind React, such as
component-based design, and some basic features of React.

This talk is geared towards intermediate developers who have some experience
with HTML and JS. It is recommended that you are familiar with some ES6 syntax
(such as `const`, `let`, `class`) but it is not necessary.

After the talk, there will be a lab which will walk you through creating your
own React app. Here's the link to the [lab](https://github.com/scottylabs/wdw-react) for
this workshop!
