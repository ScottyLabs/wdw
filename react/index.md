# React

###### A Framework for UI Development

ReactJS is an up and coming tool for creating well-structured and manageable
applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms. Its simple but powerful
API makes it a great tool for developers thinking of creating entire web
applications from scratch. In addition, it has a variety of support from
companies across the industry, such as Facebook, Netflix, AirBnB, and more! If
youâ€™re thinking of taking your web development skills to the next level, then
join us for our React talk!


## Prerequisites

Bring a computer with a web browser and a text editor installed. Chrome and
Atom are recommended. Please also have Node installed with NPM, the Node
package manager.


## Saturday: 
We will be introducing some of the core concepts behind React, such as
component-based design, and some basic features of React. Then, we will apply
these skills to developing an user interface for developing light-shows for the
Randy Pausch bridge!

This talk is geared towards intermediate developers who have some experience
with HTML and JS. It is recommended that you are familiar with some ES6 syntax
(such as `const`, `let`, `class`) but it is not necessary.
