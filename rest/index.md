# RESTful API Design

###### Designing Backend Servers with REST, MongoDB, and Express

The REST (Representational State Transfer) design paradigm is a powerful concept
for building backend servers and APIs that supply content and data to web-based
applications. REST emphasizes key concepts such as scalability, reliability,
high performance, and simplicity, each of which are crucial properties of modern
web architectures and applications. The REST paradigm is the premier design
standard for the vast majority of backend web applications and servers that make
up the internet, so it is an important concept that all modern web developers
should understand and use in their daily practices. In particular, RESTful APIs
that allow for applications to access data and information stored in databases on
remote servers have an immense impact on how the modern internet functions.

We will initially be discussing what APIs are and how they make web development easier,
and then we will delve into how databases are designed and structured by focusing upon
building databases with MongoDB.  After, we will talk about the core concepts of REST
design as well as how to build RESTful APIs with NodeJS and Express that allow for
frontend applications to access and manipulate data stored in large databases.

This talk is geared towards intermediate developers that have some experience with
JavaScript or other programming languages (Python, C, C++), but all code will be
written in JavaScript.  No frontend experience with HTML or CSS is necessary, but
frontend design experience will make it helpful to apply the concepts from the
workshop in your own websites.

## How to Attend

Bring a computer with a web browser and a text editor installed.  Please also have 
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed with NPM, the Node Package Manager.  
Additionally, installing [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) 
and an API development environment such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) 
will make the development process much easier during the workshop.
