<h3>Backend Web Development</h3>
<p>The backend is all about storing and persisting information. If you want to save a user's preferences, do complicated calculations, or store a lot of information, you're going to need a backend.
<p>Participants in this workshop will learn how to make a simple blog in Flask, a popular Python framework.
<p>Although it can be taken on its own, we recommend taking <a href="{{ "/html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">HTML & CSS</a> as well, so that you get a better idea of what's happening on the client side.

  <h3>What to bring</h3>
  <p>Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend <a href="chrome.com">Chrome</a> and <a href="sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 2</a>
  <p>You will also need to have python installed. On a Mac, this is done automatically. On Windows, follow <a href="#">these</a> instructions.
