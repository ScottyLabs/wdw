## Resources For HTML & CSS

### Reference and Tutorial Websites

  - __W3Schools__<br/>
      A great quick reference when you need a 30-second refresher on a HTML tag
      or CSS property. Its *reference* section has less verbose descriptions
      than a tutorial website, and its *try-it* examples are short and to the
      point. There are also tutorials on W3Schools, but in my opinion the
      reference is where its at.<br/>
      [HTML Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - [HTML
      Reference](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) - [CSS
      Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - [CSS
      Properties](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp) - [CSS
      Selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)
  - __TutorialsPoint__<br/>
      Usually has more in-depth explanations than W3Schools, so might be better
      if you really want to learn a lot about a topic. The tutorial is verbose
      in its entirity, but it is organized into sections, so you can jump to
      very specific topics. If you pretty much know how to write CSS, but need
      a detailed lesson on a particular thing, TutorialsPoint is perfect.<br/>

  - __CodeAcademy__<br/>
      Step by step instructions, with rendered content on the side. CodeAcademy
      has a nice learning environment, but I find it gives you too much help,
      and takes a long time to get through, relative to TutorialsPoint where you
      can skip sections you do not need.<br/>

### Design Resources
  - __Adobe Color__<br/>
      With absolutely no knowledge of color theory, you can generate some really
      satisfying color palettes from this site. Just copy the hex colors into
      your CSS.<br/>[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com)
  - __Google Fonts__<br/>
      Free web fonts that save you a bunch of time and can be loaded from
      Google's servers, reducing the strain on your machines. With Google Fonts,
      most small projects can be done without having to pay for fonts or serve
      them yourself.<br/>[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

### CSS Frameworks

It is important that you understand how CSS works, and know how to mess around
with CSS code, but it would be a waste of your time to write a ton of CSS
yourself for a simple project page or side project. Since you can apply CSS to
any webpage, there are a lot of frameworks available for use, that will come
with custom components and convenience classes that will look nice right out of
the box. For side projects, I like to start with a framework, then add on to it
as needed. Usually frameworks incorporate some sort of layout model, allowing
you to create dynamic content by just adding classes to your `<div>` tags.

  - __Materialize__<br/>
      A CSS framework to bring material design to your webpage, with absolutely
      minimal effort. It incorporates Material concepts such as cards, toasts,
      and wave animations, as well as Material color palette. It also comes with
      a large set of icons to use with it. Check out the vertical align helper
      class. Doing vertical align in CSS is so much easier with Materialize than
      with custom CSS.<br/> [Materialize](https://materializecss.com)
  - __Bootstrap__<br/>
      Before Materialize, this was the go-to framework for making things look
      less shitty with minimal effort. It is older than Materialize so has a lot
      of support, some neat JS functionality, and a large number of SO posts to
      answer any questions you may have. That said, Materialize is usually
      regarded as much better looking than bootstrap.<br/>

### Developer Tools

  - __Brackets__<br/>
      Awesome, lightweight web development environment with support for live
      previews!! Highly recommended for creating websites quickly; stop wasting
      time refreshing Google Chrome.<br/> [Brackets](https://brackets.io)
  - __CodePen__<br/>
      In-browser Web Dev playground that lets you work with HTML, CSS, and JS
      simultaneously. This is great for messing around and fiddling with CSS in
      a localized environtment, rather than your entire webpage.<br/>
      [CodePen](https://codepen.io)
  - __Chrome Developer Tools__
      View any website's source, and experiment with its CSS using this feature
      in Google Chrome. For Mac, the keyboard shortcut is `CMD+alt+i`.<br/>
