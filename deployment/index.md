# Deployment: Making Your Site Public

###### show off what you've made


In this session, you'll learn how to put whatever you've made at Web Dev Weekend
live on the web. Didn't manage to make it to any of the other sessions, but
still interested in learning how to make a site public? Don't worry: we'll give
you something to deploy.


### How to Attend

This workshop will be held on Sunday, November 8th at 1:30 p.m. in the Windows
Cluster in Wean.

If you haven't already, __[be sure to register]({{ site.registration_link }})__!
You certainly don't have to register to attend, but we like knowing how many
people to expect and what people will be interested in learning. We can't wait,
and we hope to see you there!

Be sure to bring a laptop. You'll want to make sure that either [GitHub for
Mac][gh-mac], [GitHub for Windows][gh-win], or [Git][git] & a terminal are
installed on your system.
