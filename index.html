      <div class="intro">Two weeks of workshops to jumpstart your fall semester.</div>
      <p>Web Dev Weeks is a series of lectures, workshops, and exercises that will introduce you to the fundamentals of web development.
      <p>If you want to make websites outside of the classroom, get a head start on later electives, or attend hackathons, Web Dev Weeks will give you the foundational knowledge you need to get started.

      <h2>How do I attend?</h2>
      <p>First, read <a href="{{ "/basics" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">the basics</a>. This will introduce you to some common concepts concepts and explain what the workshops are about.
      <p>Then, go to the rest of the workshops in any order. We've broken them up so that you can go to any one and learn something (although attending them all will give you the most complete set of skills).
      <p>Finally, go to <a href="{{ "/deployment" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">deployment</a>. In this one, we'll teach you how to put what you've made on the open web for free, so that anyone can see it.

      <h2>What will I learn?</h2>
      <p>We'll teach you enough to get started on your first web development project. This could be something that you work on outside of class, at a hackathon, or for a club.
      <p>Exactly what you learn will depend on what workshops you go to, and you can learn what each workshop is about by reviewing <a href="{{ "/basics" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">the basics</a>.
      <p>It's not possible to teach you everything you need to know in two hours. Many things that we consider "essential" (like mobile web developement) have been left out because of time. However, we aim to teach you foundational skills that you can build on over the rest of the semester.
