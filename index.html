      <h1>web dev weeks</h1>
      <div class="intro">Two weeks of workshops to jumpstart your fall semester.</div>
      <p>Web dev weeks is a series of lectures, workshops, and exercises that will introduce you to the fundamentals of web development.
      <p>If you want to make websites outside of the classroom, get a head start on later electives, or attend hackathons, web dev weeks will give you the foundational knowledge you need to get started.

      <h2>How do I attend?</h2>
      <p>First, read _this_ guide, the basics. This will introduce you to the basic terminology you need to understand in order to attend any of the workshops, and will briefly explain what the different workshops will cover.
      <p>Then, go to the rest of the workshops in any order. We've broken them up so that you can go to any one and learn something (although attending them all will give you the most complete set of skills).
      <p>Finally, go to the workshop: deployment. In this one, we'll teach you how to put what you've made on the open web for free, such that anyone can see it.

      <h2>What will I learn?</h2>
      <p>We'll teach you enough to get started on your first web development project. This could be something that you work on outside of class, at a hackathon, or for a club.
      <p>Exactly what you learn will depend on what workshops you go to, however you can get an idea of what each workshop is about by reviewing the basics.
      <p>It's not possible to teach you everything you need to know in two hours. Many things that we consider "essential" (like mobile web developement) have been left out for the sake of time. However, we aim to teach you foundational skills that you can build on in your own time.

      <h2>Who's running Web Dev Weeks?</h2>
      <p>Web dev weeks is run by ScottyLabs. We also run TartanHacks (CMU's largest software hackathon) and other educational events like CrashCourse. Our website is in a little bit of a transitional period, but you can visit us on facebook in the meantime.
