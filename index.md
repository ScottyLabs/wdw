##### Web Dev Weekend


Web Dev Weekend is a series of lectures, workshops, and exercises that introduce
you to the fundamentals of web development.

If you want to make websites outside of the classroom, get a head start on later
electives, or attend hackathons, Web Dev Weekend will give you the foundational
knowledge you need to get started.


## How do I register?

1. __[Register]({{site.registration_link}})__
  - You certainly don't have to register to attend, but we like knowing how many
    people to expect and what people will be interested in learning.
    <a href="{{site.registration_link}}"><button style="border:none; display:block; background-color: #CD375E; color:white; padding: 10px 16px; text-align:center; font-size:16px; border-radius:6px; margin-top:10px;"><b>Register Here!</b></button></a>
1. __[Read "The Basics"][basics]__
  - This quick read will introduce you to some common concepts and explain what
    the workshops are about.
1. __[Pick some workshops!](#schedule)__
  - Workshops are largely independent of each other: you can attend as many or
    as few as you'd like.

After participating in these workshops, you might want to show your friends the
cool things that you built.

## What will I learn?

We'll teach you enough to get started on your first web development project.
This could be something that you work on outside of class, at a hackathon, or
for a club.

Exactly what you learn will depend on what workshops you go to, and you can
learn what each workshop is about by reviewing [basics][basics].

It's not possible to teach you everything you need to know in two hours. Many
things that we consider "essential" (like mobile web development) have been left
out because of time. However, we aim to teach you foundational skills that you
can build on in the future.


## Who is running WDW?

Web Dev Weekend is run by [ScottyLabs](https://scottylabs.org). We also run
[TartanHacks](http://tartanhacks.com/) (CMU's largest software hackathon) and
other educational events like
[CrashCourse](https://scottylabs.org/crashcourse/).

## Previous Talks
