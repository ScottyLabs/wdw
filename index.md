# Web Dev Weekend

###### a weekend packed with web development workshops

Web Dev Weekend is a series of lectures, workshops, and exercises that introduce
you to the fundamentals of web development.

If you want to make websites outside of the classroom, get a head start on later
electives, or attend hackathons, Web Dev Weekend will give you the foundational
knowledge you need to get started.


## How do I attend?

1. __[Register]({{ site.registration_link }})__
  - You certainly don't have to register to attend, but we like knowing how many
    people to expect and what people will be interested in learning.
1. __[Read "The Basics"][basics]__
  - This quick read will introduce you to some common concepts and explain what
    the workshops are about.
1. __[Pick some workshops!](#schedule)__
  - Workshops are largely independent of each other: you can attend as many or
    as few as you'd like.

Make sure to check out the [deployment][deployment] workshop on the last day. In
this session, we'll teach you how to put what you've made on the open web __for
free__, so that anyone can see it.

You can go to as many or as few as you'd like. Most talks have no

## What will I learn?

We'll teach you enough to get started on your first web development project.
This could be something that you work on outside of class, at a hackathon, or
for a club.

Exactly what you learn will depend on what workshops you go to, and you can
learn what each workshop is about by reviewing [basics][basics].

It's not possible to teach you everything you need to know in two hours. Many
things that we consider "essential" (like mobile web development) have been left
out because of time. However, we aim to teach you foundational skills that you
can build on in the future.


## Who's running Web Dev Weekend?

Web Dev Weekend is run by [ScottyLabs](https://scottylabs.org). We also run
[TartanHacks](http://tartanhacks.com/) (CMU's largest software hackathon) and
other educational events like
[CrashCourse](https://scottylabs.org/crashcourse/).

We've run WDW twice before, in the Fall of 2014 and Spring of 2015.
