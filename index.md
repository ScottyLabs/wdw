# Web Dev Weekend

###### a weekend packed with web development workshops

Last fall, we ran an event called Web Dev Weeks: a series of lectures,
workshops, and exercises to introduce you to the fundamentals of web
development.

This semester, we're holding a slightly smaller event: Web Dev Weekend, which
aims to get you up and running with web development even more quickly than
before.

If you want to make websites outside of the classroom, get a head start on later
electives, or attend hackathons, Web Dev Weeks will give you the foundational
knowledge you need to get started.


## How do I attend?

1. __[Register here]({{ site.registration_link }})__
  - You certainly don't have to register to attend, but we like knowing how many
    people to expect and what people will be interested in learning.
1. __[Read "The Basics"][basics]__
  - This quick read will introduce you to some common concepts and explain what
    the workshops are about.
1. __[Pick some workshops!](#schedule)__
  - Workshops are largely independent of each other; you can pick any workshop
    regardless of what workshops you've already attended.

Make sure to check out the [deployment][deployment] workshop on the last day. In
this session, we'll teach you how to put what you've made on the open web __for
free__, so that anyone can see it.


## Schedule

All workshops will be held in the WEH 5201 Mac Cluster.

## What will I learn?

We'll teach you enough to get started on your first web development project.
This could be something that you work on outside of class, at a hackathon, or
for a club.

Exactly what you learn will depend on what workshops you go to, and you can
learn what each workshop is about by reviewing [basics][basics].

It's not possible to teach you everything you need to know in two hours. Many
things that we consider "essential" (like mobile web development) have been left
out because of time. However, we aim to teach you foundational skills that you
can build on in the future.


## Who's running Web Dev Weekend?

Web Dev Weekend is run by [ScottyLabs](http://scottylabs.org). We also run
[TartanHacks](http://tartanhacks.com/) (CMU's largest software hackathon) and
other educational events like
[CrashCourse](http://scottylabs.org/crashcourse/).
