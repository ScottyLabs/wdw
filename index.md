# web dev weeks

###### Two weeks of workshops to jumpstart your fall semester.

Web Dev Weeks is a series of lectures, workshops, and exercises that will introduce you to the fundamentals of web development.

If you want to make websites outside of the classroom, get a head start on later electives, or attend hackathons, Web Dev Weeks will give you the foundational knowledge you need to get started.

## How do I attend?
Web Dev Weeks is over for this year. However, you can still see the workshop resources, and we'll likely run the workshops in the future. Like us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ScottyLabs) to learn about new ScottyLabs events.

## What will I learn?
We'll teach you enough to get started on your first web development project. This could be something that you work on outside of class, at a hackathon, or for a club.

Exactly what you learn will depend on what workshops you go to, and you can learn what each workshop is about by reviewing [basics][basics].

It's not possible to teach you everything you need to know in two hours. Many things that we consider "essential" (like mobile web development) have been left out because of time. However, we aim to teach you foundational skills that you can build on over the rest of the semester.

## Who's running Web Dev Weeks?
Web Dev Weeks is run by [ScottyLabs](http://scottylabs.org). We also run [TartanHacks](http://tartanhacks.com/) (CMU's largest software hackathon) and other educational events like [CrashCourse](http://scottylabs.org/crashcourse-website/).
