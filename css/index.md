# Synergize Your CSS: <br>Using a Framework

###### jump-start your site's outline

CSS Frameworks are a way to make a website look nice by re-using elements of web
pages that people have found to commonly exist in modern web pages. Instead of
writing a ton of custom CSS styles, CSS frameworks allow you to build off of a
set of fine-tuned and well-tested styles that work well with a wide variety of
web sites.

This workshop is being held for the first time this semester!
