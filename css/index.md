# Synergize Your CSS: <br>Using a Framework

###### jump-start your site's outline

During this CSS Workshop we will test out some Advanced CSS tricks as well as
create a portfolio site using a CSS Framework. You'll be surprised at what you
can do in CSS and you'll find that creating a well-designed website may not be
as hard as you think. While there are different ways to use a CSS Framework,
we'll take a look at the most powerful and flexible way to use it.

This workshop is not being held this semester. Feel free to check out the
resources from previous semesters below.
